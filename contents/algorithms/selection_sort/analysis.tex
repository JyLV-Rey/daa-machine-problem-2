\subsubsection{Analysis}

% DESCRIPTION
Selection Sort shows the same time complexity in the best, average, and worst-case scenarios. This is because the number of comparisons it performs does not depend on the initial order of the elements. Whether the array is sorted, reversed, or randomly ordered, the algorithm executes the same sequence of operations.

In each pass, the algorithm identifies the smallest (or largest) element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at the current index. Since every element is compared with the remaining unsorted elements in each iteration, the total number of comparisons remains constant across all cases.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pass 1: Comparisons = $(n - 1)$, Swaps = $1$
    \item Pass 2: Comparisons = $(n - 2)$, Swaps = $1$
    \item Pass 3: Comparisons = $(n - 3)$, Swaps = $1$
    \item[] $\vdots$
    \item Pass $(n - 1)$: Comparisons = $1$, Swaps = $1$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total number of comparisons:}
\begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
        &= (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + \cdots + 2 + 1 \\
        &= \frac{(n - 1)(n)}{2} \\
        &= \frac{n^2 - n}{2} \\
        &= \textbf{\(O(n^2)\)}
    \end{align*}
\end{center}

\textbf{Total number of swaps (in the worst case):}
\begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
        &= \text{1 swap per pass} \\
        &= (n - 1) \text{ passes} \\
        &= \textbf{\(O(n)\)}
    \end{align*}
\end{center}

\textbf{Therefore, the time complexity of Selection Sort in all cases is:}
\[
\mathcal{O}(n^2)
\]
