\subsection{Bubble Sort}
\subsubsection{Analysis}

The worst-case of Bubble Sort occurs when elements are in reversed order. In such a situation, the total number of passes is exhausted or at a maximum of (n-1) times, where n is the number of elements.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pass 1: Number of Comparisons = (n-1), number of swaps = (n-1)
    \item Pass 2: Number of Comparisons = (n-2), number of swaps = (n-2)    \item Pass 3: Number of Comparisons = (n-3), number of swaps = (n-3)\\
    .\\
    .\\
    .
\item Pass (n-1): Number of Comparisons = (1), number of swaps = (1)
\end{itemize}

Calculating the total number of comparisons required to sort the array:
\begin{center}
    \begin{align*}
        &= (n-1)\ +\ (n-2)\ + (n-3)\ +\dots\ + 2\ +\ 1\\
        &= \frac{(n-1)(n-1+1)}{2}\tag{\textit{by the Sum of Natural Numbers}}\\
        &= \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\
        &= \frac{n^2 - n}{2}\\
        &= \textbf{\(O(n^2)\)}
    \end{align*}
\end{center}

Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).
