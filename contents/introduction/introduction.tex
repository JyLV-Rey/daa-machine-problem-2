\subsection{Description}
The Brute Force Strategy is a fundamental algorithm design technique that works by systematically checking all possible solutions in order to find the correct one. It performs an exhaustive search of the entire solution space, without incorporating any form of optimization or heuristic shortcuts. While brute force algorithms are relatively simple to design and implement, and they guarantee a correct solution when one exists, they are typically inefficient for large or complex problems due to their high time complexity.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Brute Force Strategy, discussing its key algorithms, advantages, limitations, and common real-world applications. It includes detailed analyses of time complexity and practical examples to illustrate how brute force algorithms work. Additionally, the report explores possible optimization techniques that can enhance the efficiency of brute force approaches, offering valuable insights into when and how this strategy can be effectively applied.
