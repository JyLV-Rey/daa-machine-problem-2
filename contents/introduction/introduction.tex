\subsection{Description}
The Brute Force Strategy is a one of the most fundamental algorithm design techniques that works by systematically checking all possible solutions in order to find the correct one. It performs an exhaustive search of the entire solution space, without incorporating any form of optimization or heuristic shortcuts. 

These powerful algorithms, while being relatively simple to design and implement along with guaranteeing a correct solution when one exists, they are typically inefficient for large or complex problems due to their high time complexity. This calls for optimization ideas, alongside the creative implementation of data structures to further help with the storing and accessing of data to be processed.

This massive document report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the \textbf{Brute Force Strategy}, discussing its key algorithms, advantages, limitations, and common real-world applications. Included aswell are the detailed analyses of time complexity and practical examples to illustrate how brute force algorithms work and scale as the input grows. It also explores possible optimization techniques that can enhance the efficiency of brute force approaches, hopefully offering valuable insights into when and how this strategy can be effectively applied.
