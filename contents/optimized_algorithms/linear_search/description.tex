\subsection{Optimized Linear Search}

% DESCRIPTION
\subsubsection{Description}

This optimized Linear Search algorithm implements a bidirectional search that aims to improve practical runtime efficiency. Instead of scanning the array in one direction, it compares elements both from left and right ends simultaneously in each iteration. 

By this, it can possibly locate the target value in half the time, especially when the value is located near the boundaries of the list. In addition, to further optimize the algorithm,  a modulo condition is applied before performing a full comparison. This happens by checking whether the last digit of the current element matches the last digit of the target value using the expression $value \% 10$. 

If the condition is not met, the element is skipped, reducing unnecessary comparisons. In addition, the search terminates immediately once a match is found, ensuring early exit in favorable cases. Although the worst case time complexity stays the same %, this optimized version offers improved runtime performance in many practical scenarios due to its dual direction scanning and digit based filtering.
